**Class session:** Friday (3:30 pm until 6:15 pm), 
**Classroom:**	   121 Robinson Hall

**Instructor:**   Ashis K Chanda, 
**Office hour:**	Thursday (4-5 PM)

**Description:**

This course introduces concepts, approaches and techniques of artificial intelligence (AI), and focuses on materials that are fundamental and have a broad scope of applications. Topics include Problem Solving, Heuristic search, Knowledge and Reasoning, Logical Agents, First-Order Logic and Inference, Uncertain Knowledge and Reasoning, puzzle-solving, game-playing, natural language processing, and expert systems. Additional topics include Machine Learning, Neural Computation, and Evolutionary Computation.

**The primary objectives of the course are:**
 * To get a broad understanding of the basic problems and the proposed solutions in all major branches of artificial intelligence.
 * To get some research experiences in AI by exploring certain topics in depth.
 * To gain experience on Prolog and Python programming to solve real life problems. 

**Textbooks:**
 * S. Russell and P. Norvig, Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, 4th edition, Prentice Hall.

**Prerequisite:**
Discrete mathematics, probability, computer programming, algorithm and data structures.


**Grading Scheme:**
 * Quiz (20%): During class time (around 10-12 quizzes)
 * Assignment (20%): 1 week time period (after class) [Written or programming assignment] [You are open to discuss with others]
 * Presentation (10%): One 10-15 minute paper presentation in a group
 * Midterm exam (25%): 2 hours (you can bring a single handwritten note)
 * Final Exam (25%):  2:30 hours (you can bring your previous midterm note with another additional single page note)

###### Policies:
 * Late Work: 10% late submission penalty if submitted within one day of deadline. Beyond that, late submission is not entertained.
 * An extra credit assignment (could also be a quiz or an exam) may be given, but the exact date of the extra credit is not decided yet.
 * If you cannot attend the midterm exam due to personal reasons, please let me know before the exam.
 * You must attend the final exam at the prescribed time in order to pass this course.
