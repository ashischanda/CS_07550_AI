# Class Project Guidelines

**Objective:**
Presenting a problem (i.e. classification, regression, â€¦) and proposing machine learning methods to solve the problem and develop an intelligent system for that.

**Specifications:**
* Presentation duration: 10 minutes [2 minutes for questions, total 12 minutes]
* PowerPoint presentations are required.
* Submit your project proposal through the canvas before 11/09/21. 
* Submit your presentation and program files (python or ipynb file(s)) through the canvas before afternoon (2 PM) on Friday, December 3rd.
* Since it is a four weeks work submission, it is expected that each participant in a team will work for approximately 40 hours in total.

**Project proposal:**
* Project proposal should be 1 to 1.5 pages in length with 11pt font size.
* It should contain project title and student name(s).
* Introduction Section: give motivation; describe the problem; mention related works.  
* Proposed Work Section: explain the idea; explain proposed approaches.  
* Timeline: propose the timeline for the project (state what will be done after Week 1, 2, 3)
* References: provide at least 2 related references (could be a web link)
 

**Typical structure of a presentation:**
Project title with names of the team members [1 slide]
Introduction: what is the topic and objective of your project [1 slide]
Approach:  Explain the idea, proposed approaches and methodology [1 or 2 slides]
Results: what you have done so far, show results in form of tables and figures, discuss results [1 or 2 slides]
Conclusion & future work: summarize the whole project and what you still have to do [1 slide]
Contribution & references: Explain the contribution of each member in the project work and clearly acknowledge the web resources you used. [1 slide]
Not more than 10 slides in total.
 

**Grading scheme:**
* 10% on project proposal [detail problem explanations and motivations]
* 10% on powerpoint presentation [slides are organized and professional looking]
* 30% on the quality of oral presentation 

(1) clearly explain motivation, plans, and results; 

(2) motivate the audience

* 30% how far did you go with the project [program or code, results, result explanation]
* 10% answers to the questions during discussion
